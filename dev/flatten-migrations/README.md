This instruction will help you to flatten all migrations that were present in the given commit into the sql-seed and local-testing-data files.
Later in this text we will assume that this commit has a tag `release`.
Note: before the shell commands the required current working directory is indicated. The case of three dots means that
current working directory doesn't matter (but inside of the repository).

1. Go to the flattening scripts directory:
```
(atlas) cd dev/flatten-migrations
```
2. Copy the directory contents to the directory not visible to the git (we will need this later):
```
(atlas/dev/flatten-migrations) mkdir ../flatten && cd ../flatten
(atlas/dev/flatten) cp ../flatten-migrations/* .
```
3. Set up the environment needed by scripts:
```
(atlas/dev/flatten) export SQL_SEED_DIR=../sql-seed
(atlas/dev/flatten) export LOCAL_DATA_DIR=../local-testing-data
(atlas/dev/flatten) export MIGRATIONS_DIR=../migrations
```
4. Go to the wanted commit:
```
(...) git checkout release
```
5. Collect all the migrations file names from that commit:
```
(atlas/dev/flatten) ./get_all_migrations.sh old
```
6. Go to the current branch:
```
(...) git checkout <current branch>
```
7. Collect all the migrations file names from current branch:
```
(atlas/dev/flatten) ./get_all_migrations.sh new
```
8. Get diffs. Note that the names of common migrations should be the same in the release and in the current branch:
```
(atlas/dev/flatten) ./diff_all_migrations.sh
```
9. Check that diffs are just the lists of extra migrations:
```
cat *.diff
```
10. Remove extra migrations from the migrations directories, later we will restore them:
```
(atlas/dev/flatten) ./store_extra_migrations.sh
```
11. Run the docker containers and run the migrations in the separate consoles:
```
(atlas/dev) docker-compose up
(atlas) ./dev/run.sh
```
12. Save the image of the database state using pg_dump:
```
(atlas/dev/flatten) CONN_STRING="host=localhost port=5434 user=atlas dbname=atlas_dev password=atlas"
(atlas/dev/flatten) pg_dump "$CONN_STRING" -s > old.dump && pg_dump "$CONN_STRING" -a --rows-per-insert=1000 >> old.dump
```
13. Get local testing data. Note that due to migrations changes some tables may not be present in the output
    local-testing-data files. If this occurs, you have to add this tables to the schema_info.sh, see extra_test_data_tables. Then try again.
```
(atlas/dev/flatten) ./flatten_all.sh fetch_inserts
```
14. Stop docker and servers (Ctrl+C and then `docker-compose down` for docker, Ctrl+C for stopping `./dev/run.sh`)
15. Hide obtained local-testing-data files:
```
(atlas/dev/flatten) ./remove_test_data.sh
```
16. Run docker and migrations again (see 11)
17. Flatten the migrations:
```
(atlas/dev/flatten) ./flatten_all.sh flatten
```
18. Restore the local-testing-data files:
```
(atlas/dev/flatten) ./restore_test_data.sh
```
19. Stop docker and servers (see 13) and start them again (see 11)
20. Save the new database image:
```
(atlas/dev/flatten) pg_dump "$CONN_STRING" -s > new.dump && pg_dump "$CONN_STRING" -a --rows-per-insert=1000 >> new.dump
```
21. Compare the old image and the new one:
```
diff old.dump new.dump > diff.dump
less diff.dump
```
Ideally this diff should contain only changes in `schema_migrations` table, but also possible some other changes in the geometry or fare policies tables. Mostly I think it doesn't matter.
22. Restore the extra migrations:
```
(atlas/dev/flatten) ./return_migrations.sh
```
23. Rerun docker and run tests to make sure that everything is OK:
```
(...) stack test --fast
```
24. Check that all the database schemas are OK and the same as before this entire procedure
25. You're adorable!
